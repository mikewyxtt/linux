	  Apple SoCs have various co-processors required for certain
	  peripherals to work (NVMe, display controller, etc.). This
	  driver adds support for the mailbox controller used to
	  communicate with those.

	help
	  Apple SoCs such as the M1 come with various co-processors running
	  their proprietary RTKit operating system. This option enables support
	  for the protocol library used to communicate with those. It is used
	  by various client drivers.

	  Say 'y' here if you have an Apple SoC.

	  Apple SART is a simple DMA address filter used on Apple SoCs such
	  as the M1. It is usually required for the NVMe coprocessor which does
	  not use a proper IOMMU.

	  Say 'y' here if you have an Apple SoC.

	  A co-processor persent on certain Apple SoCs controlling accelerometers,
	  gyros, ambient light sensors and microphones. Is not actually always on.

	  A security co-processor persent on Apple SoCs, controlling transparent
	  disk encryption, secure boot, HDCP, biometric auth and probably more.

	  Say 'y' here if you have an Apple SoC.
